# Virtual DeskTop Assistant using Python

A project to build an AI voice assistant using Python . The Voice assistant interacts with the humans to automate daily basic tasks.


## About

Assistancy is an AI personal DeskTop assistant service built using Python. It can understand human speech and perform basic daily tasks given by the user.

When the user clicks the "SPEAK" button and specifies the appropriate trigger words , The Assistancy gets activated and executes the user commands accordingly.

If the user commands does not contain the trigger words, it searches using the Wolframe|Alpha API.

Assistancy AI Voice assistant:"Good Morning (Greets the user according to time), I am your Assistancy, How can I help you?"

This project is build by the Members of Group - 3, Tools and Techniques Laboratory, KIIT.

## Functions() used:

- speak() Function: It is used to insert the output generated by the program inside the ListBox as well as print and speak [output the voice] through the engine.say() and engine.runAndWait() methods.
```bash
  def speak(audio):
    mylist.insert(END, "Assistancy" + " : " + audio)
    root.update()
    print("Assistancy" + " : " + audio)
    engine.say(audio)
    engine.runAndWait()
```

- wishMe() Function: This function is used to greet the user according to the time of the day. This function is executed only once when the program begins.
```bash
  def wishMe():
    hour = int(datetime.datetime.now().hour)
    if hour >= 0 and hour < 12:
        speak("Good Morning")
    elif hour >= 12 and hour < 17:
        speak("Good Afternoon")
    else:
        speak("Good Evening")

    speak("I am your assistancy. How can i help you?")
```

- takeCommand() Function: This function is used to take voice input from the user. It runs in an infinite while loop until the speech recognision function finds some understanding words. The loop begins again if the program was unable to detect any meaningful english commands.
```bash
  def takeCommand():
    while(True):

        r = sr.Recognizer()

        with sr.Microphone() as source:

            print("Listening...")
            r.pause_threshold = 1
            audio = r.listen(source, phrase_time_limit=5)

        try:
            print("Recognizing...")
            query = r.recognize_google(audio, language='en-in')
            mylist.insert(END, "User said : " + query)
            root.update()
            print(f"User said: {query}\n")
            return query

        except Exception as e:
            print(e)
            print("Unable to Recognize your voice. Please say again.")
```

- date() Function: This function is used to calculate todays date and speak it.
```bash
  def date():
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    my_date = datetime.datetime.today()

    month_name = now.month
    day_name = now.day
    month_names = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June',
                   'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']
    ordinalnames = ['1st', '2nd', '3rd', ' 4th', '5th', '6th', '7th', '8th', '9th', '10th', '11th', '12th', '13th', '14th', '15th',
                    '16th', '17th', '18th', '19th', '20th', '21st', '22nd', '23rd', '24rd', '25th', '26th', '27th', '28th', '29th', '30th', '31st']

    speak("Today is " + month_names[month_name-1] +
          " " + ordinalnames[day_name-1] + '.')
```

- note() Function: This function is used only when the user gives command to take a note.
```bash
  def note(text):
    date = datetime.datetime.now()
    file_name = str(date).replace(":", "-") + "-note.txt"
    with open(file_name, "w") as f:
        f.write(text)

    subprocess.Popen(["notepad.exe", file_name])
```

- main() function : Contains the main code of the program where all the functions are invoked and executed.
```bash
  def main_function():
    .........       .........
```
## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The Graphical User Interface is implemented with tkinter library.Out of all the GUI methods, tkinter is the most commonly used method. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Let's have a look how it is used in this project.

```bash
root = Tk()
w = Label(root, text='Welcome back User!')
w.pack()

root.title('Assistancy - your favourite personal assistant')
ourMessage = 'Tool and Techniques Lab, Group - 3'
messageVar = Message(root, text=ourMessage, width=300)
messageVar.config(bg='lightgreen')
messageVar.pack()

# ScrollBar
scrollbar = Scrollbar(root)
scrollbar.pack(side=RIGHT, fill=Y)

# ListBox
mylist = Listbox(root, height=20, width=40, yscrollcommand=scrollbar.set)

mylist.pack(fill=BOTH)
scrollbar.config(command=mylist.yview)
root.geometry('700x500')
root.minsize(700, 500)
```
The above code creates a frame called root and packs the Label , Message, ScrollBar and ListBox with the root.

```bash
frame = Frame(root)
frame.pack()
greenbutton = Button(frame, text='SPEAK', fg='green', command=main_function)
greenbutton.pack(side=LEFT)
redbutton = Button(frame, text='STOP', fg='red', command=root.destroy)
redbutton.pack(side=LEFT)

root.mainloop()
```
At the end, the root frame is wrapped up and buttons are added to the frame and assigned functionalities to each function.
